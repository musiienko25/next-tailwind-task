# TypeScript Next.js Tailwind project

This is a really simple project that shows the usage of Next.js with TypeScript.

## How to run a project

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Ð¡onditions of the task

```bash
Build a simple web application with Next.js (Typescript!) Use Tailwind CSS for the design.
The app should display a list of items from a mock JSON file. This shows how you handle data.
Make sure the design works well on both phones and computers.
Add a couple of pages to the app and set up navigation between them.

What I'm Looking For:
A link to your GitHub with the project code. Make sure your code is neat and you explain any big decisions you made.
A README file that tells me how to get your app running on my computer.
```
